## Release Notes
 
* Rev 1.0/1.1 (PCB silkscreen is 1.0): Build #0 (5 board pilot run), Build #1 (44 boards)
* Rev 1.2: Build #2 (68 boards), Build #3 (72 boards)
  * Added J10 jumper on power input from IEEE-1394 (jumper OFF -> no power from IEEE-1394)
  * Changed J9 from 4-pin 2 mm header to 5-pin 0.1" header; pin 5 is connected to GND
  * Did not populate U12 (29.4989 MHz oscillator); use FPGA PLL to generate this frequency
* Rev 1.3: Build #4 (80 boards)
  * Added protection diodes (D10-D17), shunt regulator (U12), and supporting components to FireWire signal lines
  * Enable off-board 5V and 3.3V power (via U4 and U5) after local 5V power is good (determined by U9)
  * Added holes/pads on PCB traces for 5V, 3.3V, and 1.2V power supplies to facilitate troubleshooting
  * Removed 29.4989 MHz oscillator (U12) and supporting components from PCB and BOM (was "Do Not Install")
  * Modified U2 footprint to accommodate all variants of SO-8 package
  * Changed internal layers from 2 oz to 1 oz copper
* Rev 2.0: Prototype build (3 boards)
  * Added 10BASE-T/100BASE-TX Ethernet port using Micrel KSZ8851-16MLL MAC/PHY chip.
  * Redesigned DC/DC power supplies (5V, 3.3V, and 1.2V) to provide higher output currents.
  * Removed USB Mini connector (J6) and associated USB to UART bridge chip (CP2103). It is still possible to obtain a USB interface by connecting an appropriate TTL to USB Serial Converter Cable to header J9.
  * Removed jumper (J10) that allowed board to obtain power from IEEE-1394 cable (this feature was never used). Also removed power passthrough between IEEE-1394 connectors.
  * Removed diode isolation between power supply connectors J5 and J7; power should be connected to only one of these.
  * Changed FPGA oscillator from 40 MHz (pin AB12) to 25 MHz (pin M3).
  * Changes to the I/O pin connections on the FPGA (see schematic).
* Rev 2.1: Build #5 (92 boards), Build #6 (75 boards), Build #7 (120 boards), Build #8 (80 boards)
  * Moved power connector (J5) to increase space for JTAG connector (J8).
  * Corrected connection of "ST" and "FPGA PROG" LEDs (were swapped in Rev 2.0).
  * Fixed one unconnected GND test point, moved voltage test points, and added one more GND test point.
  * Changes to facilitate board assembly: wider slot spacing for IEEE-1394 connector, notch on board edge for better seating of IEEE-1394 connector, changed pad size for L1-L3.
* Rev 3.x: See [this repository](https://github.com/jhu-cisst/FPGA1394V3)
